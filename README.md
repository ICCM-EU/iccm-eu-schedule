# ICCM Conference Schedule View (Angular)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

It represents different views on a schedule stored in a google sheet
which is also connected to a conference app, made with https://glideapps.com/

## Development server

Run `ng serve --port=4200 --live-reload=true` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build for production

Run `ng build --prod --output-path docs --base-href /iccm-eu-2020/` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `docs/` directory.

Copy docs/index.html to docs/404.html to allow all content to be provided on github.
