In your office, are you on top of your software licensing, EULAs, data protection and other requirements relating to your digital data? Have you taken into account the corporate reputation or ethics of your secular IT software, hardware or service provider, before using their offerings?When it comes down to the use of cheap and cheerful IT products, highly convenient solutions, or the unavoidable secular giants of the IT Cloud world, we seem to have distanced ourselves from our Biblical ethics and morality. The unpleasant thought of spending more money, more time or more resources to come up with an alternative solution, dulls the reality that many secular IT corporations, are using practices that are in direct conflict with our Biblical worldview. It's not a secret that Western corporate greed for profit and control is a cancer to our society, leading to scandals in the news when they are exposed, and involving many of our IT providers.In this workshop, we will look at what the Bible and related readings have to say, in order to help us choose an ethical and moral approach to our decision-making process. We will also reflect on the challenges to implementing an uncompromising biblical position when dealing with secular IT providers.",
